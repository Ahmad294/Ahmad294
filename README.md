👋 Hi, I'm Ahmad

I’m a Frontend Engineer who enjoys turning complex ideas into clean, usable interfaces.
My main playground is React & modern web technologies, and I care a lot about performance, clarity, and good UX.

I like building things that are:

⚡ Fast

🎯 Purpose-driven

🧩 Easy to maintain

Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by diving into Go (Golang) to better understand backend systems and scalable architectures.
